# Cookie Clicker

## Info

[Cookie Clicker Game Link](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)

I've played Cookie Clicker several times, and most recently started playing the Steam version. Keeping a record of my strategy here. Most of this file will likely not be created by me, but compiled from various sources around the web.

## Sugar Lumps Purchase Order

Most of this comes from [Hecent's guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2712325027) on Steam.

1. Wizard Towers (unlock Grimoire) **[1]**
2. Temples (unlock Pantheon) **[1]**
3. Farms (unlock Garden) **[1]**
4. Banks (unlock Stock Market) **[1]**
5. Garden to level 9 **[44]**

## Pantheon

**Skruuia** can be slotted just before popping wrinklers and the player will still recieve the increased cookies from wrinklers.

Active build:
 * Godzamok
 * Mokalsium
 * Muridal
 > Godzamok -> when you have a 7x cookie multiplier (and/or building multiplier) as well as a click multiplier, you sell all your farms, mines, factories, and banks before clicking the cookie.

Idle build:
 * Mokalsium - Milk is +% more powerful
 * Holobore - +% base CpS
 * Jeremy - Buildings produce +% more
 * Cyclius - CpS bonus fluctuating between +15% and -15% over time

## Seasons
 - Christmas (Santas)
 - Christmas (Reindeer)
 - Easter
 - Halloween
 - activate Heavenly Chips
 - Valentine

From: https://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/ddnfja/whats_everyones_season_switcher_strategy/

Because I have the Beginner's Luck heavenly upgrade, I go to Christmas immediately to get the Santas (for the random drop boost) and the Reindeer, then Easter, then Halloween, then activate the heavenly chips, go Valentine's quickly, then turn it off. I'll turn on Easter or Valentine's periodically if I need the third column for FTHOF, but this way, I only need four season switches to start off, which saves on cookies. I also have the omelette in a permanent slot, which saves a boatload of time by boosting my random chance more, and pop Mind Over Matter as soon as I get 100 Antimatter Condensers.

If you don't have Beginner's Luck, you might as well go Valentine's first, since it takes like 30 seconds to get all the Valentine's cookies, but then still go Christmas-Easter-Halloween, since that seems the most efficient to me?

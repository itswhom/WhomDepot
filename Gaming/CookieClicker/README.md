# Cookie Clicker Strategy

I've played Cookie Clicker several times, and most recently started playing the Steam version. Keeping a record of my strategy here. Most of this file will likely not be created by me, but compiled from various sources around the web.

## Sugar Lumps Purchase Order

Most of this comes from [Hecent's guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2712325027) on Steam.

1. Wizard Towers (unlock Grimoire) **[1]**
2. Temples (unlock Pantheon) **[1]**
3. Farms (unlock Garden) **[1]**
4. Banks (unlock Stock Market) **[1]**
5. Garden to level 9 **[44]**

## Pantheon

**Skruuia** can be slotted just before popping wrinklers and the player will still recieve the increased cookies from wrinklers.

   * NOTE: This means that in order to be able to only grow spawn a Golden Clover, and have no chance of spawning regular clover, you should have at least 5 clovers around each open plot with at least 4 or them being mature.  In order to have the highest mutation rate, albeit with the possibility of generating regular clover, you should have exactly 4x mature clover around each open plot.
